               and wanted to climb some trees, while we supervised.

               <p class="funParagraph">Big Sur has several campground that are available.
                  Some of the campground had beautiful cabins but we opted out for camping in a tent.
                  Big Lodge Sur was one of the bigger campground and has plenty of spots to pick from.
                  Few things to remember about Big Sur: the bears are very real and cell service is nonexistent.
